 calligraphy. The script is written in a bright yellow color against a light gray background. The calligraphy consists of a series of connected, flowing lines and curves, characteristic of Arabic script. The design includes several distinct elements:

- Two vertical lines on the right side, with one slightly shorter than the other.
- A horizontal line crossing the vertical lines near the top.
- A series of curved lines and loops extending to the left, forming the rest of the characters.
- Small diacritical marks above and below the main lines, which are used in Arabic to indicate vowel sounds and pronunciation.

The overall appearance is elegant and stylized, typical of traditional Arabic calligraphy.
